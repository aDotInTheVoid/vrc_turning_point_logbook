\subsection{Nixon: Drivetrain}

To start out with, Nixon build a drivetrain frame.
This is because we were not sure what a optimal claw would look like yet and Nixon hadn't build enough lift yet to be trusted with building one.
Therefor he was entrusted with the drivetrain as this was a common component that he had built before.
\par

A decision was made to build the drivetrain frame out of c-chanels at it had worked reasonably well in the past and we had plenty of them.
However the question now became how to properly join them at right angles into a strong and stable rectangle.
\par

On previous occasions we had decided just to screw the c-chanels together at the end with one screw, however this led to two problems.
\par

\begin{itemize}
	\item There was no garentee that the frame would stay square.
	      Sure, it might be held in place by by the other stuff we end up putting on but then again it might not.
	      And we want the drivetrain to suport the robot, and not the otherway round.
	\item Becase of the way they'd be atached (TODO: figure) the beems
	      runing perpendicular to eachother would we at slightly different hights,
	      constraining what we could do in terms of building the rest of the robot.
\end{itemize}

Therefor we needeed another, better way to atach the c-chanels together.

% \subsection{Oscar: Claw}

% A claw for rotating a object as large as a cap has never been built by anyone on our team before. Therefor we decided to build
% physical prototypes of the claw to see what design would be better \par

% We made two different prototypes which were quite similar in design, 
% both were fixed beams coming from a plate at the back, which were simply 
% to be driven into the caps and held. 
% It was decided that they should be held loosely so that there was room for human error when driven towards, and so that they would slide back off with ease once on the posts.
% This decision was made
